# Final Project - Introduction to Robotics
### by Fabian Becker, Florian Remberger and Tanh

We probably need to add some documentation here in the future

## TODO

- [x] Import task data
- [x] Pathfinding with Dijkstra Algorithm
- [x] Implement sound function
- [x] implement driveTile and turn functions
- [ ] optimize driveTile function with speed sensor values
- [ ] optimize Dijkstra results 
- [ ] port code to robot
